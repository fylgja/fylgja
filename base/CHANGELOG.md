## Unreleased

### Added

- Custom `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to buttons to prevent the default browser highlight from affecting brand colors.

### Removed

- `article` element from scoped preflight styles, allowing only class-based options.
  This change was made because lists of products or posts can also be considered articles,
  making the previous default behavior for the scoped version less appropriate.

## 2.0.0 - 2025-03-12

Fylgja Base has been completely rebuilt,
consolidating core v1 classless components into a single,
highly optimized package.

Designed for minimal size without sacrificing features,
it delivers a comprehensive starter, normalization, and preflight CSS solution.
